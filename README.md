## About

The Timefall project is an open-source software that is being developed to provide users with an efficient and convenient time management tool. Created with modern software trends in mind, Timefall is a tool accessible to anyone who wants to better understand how they allocate their time and how it can be used most productively. It's a simple yet powerful tool capable of adapting to each user's needs.

## Features

### Task Creation with Hourly Rate

The app allows you to create tasks and specify an hourly rate for each task. This feature is useful for tracking time and calculating payment.

### Task Organization
You can organize your tasks by grouping them into folders. This helps you easily find relevant tasks and manage them efficiently.

### Time Entries with Hourly Rate Calculation

Timefall displays time entries grouped by days. You’ll see how much time was spent on each task, along with the calculated hourly payment.

### Reports for Weeks, Months, and Years

You can analyze your productivity by viewing reports for different time periods. This feature helps you understand how effectively you manage your time.

### Privacy
Timefall uses a simple JSON-based database stored locally on your computer, rather than in the cloud.

## Who is Timefall Useful for?
